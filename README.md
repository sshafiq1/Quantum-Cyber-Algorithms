# Assessing Trade-Offs in Utilising BB84 vs B92 for Quantum Key Distribution

### Team members: Rose Zhao, Sarah Shafiq, Hanvitha Kunkalaguntla

## Description:
This research project investigates the security and performance trade-offs between two foundational quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols: BB84 and B92. While B92 offers simplified implementation by using only two non-orthogonal polarization states, BB84—leveraging two mutually unbiased bases—is considered the gold standard due to its stronger security against eavesdropping attacks.

To quantify these differences,  We are developing a Monte Carlo simulation in Python that models intercept-resend attacks and evaluates key rate and error thresholds. This includes exploring advanced quantum information concepts such as the Breidbart basis, minimum-error discrimination, and the Helstrom bound. Through this work, we aim to numerically demonstrate BB84’s superior security margin over B92 while also identifying scenarios where B92 may be practically advantageous due to cost or implementation constraints.

The project integrates quantum theory with statistical simulation and visualization, requiring fluency in QKD protocols, attack models, and Monte Carlo methods.
